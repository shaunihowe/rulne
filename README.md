# Rulne

A game I wrote in 2002 using Visual Basic 6.

This is a turn based game where each player must choose a number along the yellow bar, after each move the yellow bar rotates around the last chosen number.

* Play continues until there are no numbers left or there are no legal moves remaining.
* The player whose chosen numbers add up to the higher value wins.

* Includes a primitive AI with multiple difficulty levels.
